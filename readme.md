# My portfolio

this is my portfolio here you will be able to see a little bit about myself and who I am, some of the projects i've been working on and you can also contact me with the links at the bottom. I would appriciate it if you could see the deployed application. I tried my best at using the right semantics, css properties and making a good responsive layout. Please let me know if there is something in which i can improve.
